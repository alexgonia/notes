Cirrus Bybit (from SG3G) is now connected to your Tokyo server, and I have verified that it's working from the network side. Let me know when you are able to switch the Bybit part of the app to use NIC eth2.2455. This is similar to Binance, need to make the change in the app to switch over and then you will benefit from the latency optimization. Curious to see by how much the improvement is.
