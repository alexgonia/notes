Those are Cirrus IPs (similar to the non- 203. ones here

The difference is that those are not actively used for your VRFs right now. So if you must eliminate some, those are the best to eliminate. Try to stay within a group of 3 (ideally the first one)First Group  

- 18.142.211.23
- 3.1.2.58
- 18.143.209.16

Second Group  

- 13.215.25.25
- 18.142.59.99
- 13.251.224.223

though the best long term solution would be if we could keep them all around because those links could be faster at times and by removing them from the whitelist we are restricting options for that paths)But for the issue at hand, they are not needed and could all be eliminated
